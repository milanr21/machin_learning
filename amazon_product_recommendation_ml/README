# Product Recommender System with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

# Description:

Built a machine learning-based product recommender using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to suggest similar Amazon products based on user queries. Integrated NLTK for text preprocessing and Streamlit for creating an interactive web interface, delivering real-time recommendations.
# Tools and Technologies Used:

Python
Programming language for implementing machine learning and data processing logic.

Pandas
For data manipulation and handling CSV files.

NumPy
Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
For text tokenization, stemming, and processing natural language data.

Scikit-learn
For implementing machine learning algorithms, specifically TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

Streamlit
For building the interactive web application and user interface for the recommender system.

PIL (Python Imaging Library)
For displaying images within the web app.

CSV Files
Amazon product data used for training the recommendation model.
