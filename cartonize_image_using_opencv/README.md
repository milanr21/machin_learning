# Image Cartoonization Using Edge Detection and Color Quantization

#  Description

Developed an image cartoonization tool using OpenCV for edge detection, K-Means clustering for color quantization, and bilateral filtering to smooth the image. The system processes an image to create a cartoon effect by reducing the color palette and emphasizing edges, providing a fun and artistic transformation of input images.

# Tools and Technologies Used:

Python
Programming language for implementing the image processing logic.

OpenCV
For image manipulation, including reading images, color quantization, edge detection, and applying filters.

NumPy
Used for array manipulation and efficient numerical operations.

Matplotlib
For visualizing images and displaying the results.

K-Means Clustering
Used for color quantization to reduce the number of colors in the image.
