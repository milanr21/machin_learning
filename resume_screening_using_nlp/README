# Resume Classification and Categorization System

# Description: 
Developed an automated resume categorization system that uses machine learning (k-Nearest Neighbors classifier) to classify resumes into predefined categories like Data Science, HR, Web Designing, and more. The system leverages TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and utilizes scikit-learn for model training. The process involves data cleaning, text preprocessing, and prediction through a trained classifier.

# Tools & Technologies Used:

    Python
    scikit-learn
    Pandas & NumPy
    TF-IDF Vectorization
    k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Streamlit (for web interface)
    pickle (for saving and loading models)
    Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
